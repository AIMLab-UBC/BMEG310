# Lab 3 Deliverable

```{r, include=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/Ali Chamkalani/Desktop/BMEG310 2022")
```

1- Load the data from the directory
```{r,results='hide'}
data <- read.table("deliverable.txt")
```

The loaded dataset is a dataframe with 6 columns and 2128 rows. 
```{r}
dim(data)
```

and column names of:
```{r}
colnames(data)
```



2- Call ggplot

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

3- You need to make a violin plot that subset the data into factor sex. Your final plot should should look like the one below. 

Hint 1: This is a two-line code!

Hint 2: Convert sex to a factor then fill the violin plot with it


```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x=Diagnosis, y=Age)) + 
  geom_violin(aes(fill = factor(Sex)))
```
