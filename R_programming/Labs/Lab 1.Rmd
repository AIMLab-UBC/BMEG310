## Installing rmarkdown package

We assume you have already installed R and the RStudio IDE.Next you need to install the rmarkdown package in R:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,results='hide'}
# Install from rmarkdown and TinyTeX from CRAN
install.packages('rmarkdown', repos="http://cran.r-project.org")
install.packages('tinytex', repos="http://cran.r-project.org")
tinytex::install_tinytex(force = TRUE)  # install TinyTeX
```
Open a new markup file, then create a chunk and paste the following chunk into it

```{r}
print("Your student number")
```

## Rendering
To transform your markdown file into PDF document, click the “Knit” icon that appears above your file in the scripts editor. A drop down menu will let you select the **Knit to Pdf**
