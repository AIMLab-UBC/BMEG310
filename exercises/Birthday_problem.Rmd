```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
birthdayProblem = function(n_people,n_possibilities){
  p=1
  for(i in 1:n_people){
    p=p*((n_possibilities - i + 1) / n_possibilities)
  }
  return(1-p);
}
```

## Testing the birthday problem code (should be ~50% or 0.5)
```{r}
birthdayProblem(23,365)
```

## A 10X experiment
```{r}
birthdayProblem(10000,3E6)
```


# How many cells before there is a 50:50 chance of a collision?

I did this by manual binary search (aka trial and error, binary search style)
```{r}
birthdayProblem(2041,3E6)
```
