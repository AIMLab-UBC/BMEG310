## Survival Ananysis

### Adult Body Mass Index (BMI)
BMI is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fat.

To calculate BMI, see [the Adult BMI Calculator](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html) or determine BMI by finding your height and weight in this [BMI Index Chart](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi_tbl.htm).

Create a column named `bmi.class` and append to the extracted (reduced) clinical data. Then assign the classified `bmi` into 5 groups as outlined below.

If your BMI is less than 18.5, it falls within the `underweight` range. If your BMI is 18.5 to <25, it falls within the `healthy` weight range. If your BMI is 25.0 to <30, it falls within the `overweight` range. If your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the `obesity` range.Finally if bmi is `NA`, set bmi.class equal to `NA`, too.

**how does <u>Body Mass Index</u> affect survival?**

1) Please plot **survival probability**  and **risk table** 

2) Is the null hypotheses true? Is there a statistically significant correlation between BMI and survival?
