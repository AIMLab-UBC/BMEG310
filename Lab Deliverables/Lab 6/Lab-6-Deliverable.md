# **Lab 6 Deliverable: Supervised Learning**

Using the `Smarket` dataset of the `ISLR` R package (also used in the classification section of the tutorial), perform a logistic regression model to predict `Direction` based on `Lag1`, `Lag2`, and `Lag3` variables only (leave out all other variables). Submit the Classification rate and summary of glm.fit to Canvas.
