# Lab 9

This deliverable relates to the course project. 

At this point you have already downloaded the datasets associated with the project. In this session, we would like you to explore and start analyzing the mutation and clinical data. 

Action 1: Read the main TCGA paper associated with your project. This is provided in the presentation associated with the project (available on Canvas). Provide an itemized list of the key findings related to the analysis of mutational and clinical data from the papers. 

Action 2: Plot the age distribution of the cases in your study. This should be in the form of a boxplot. Note, you need to restrict your analysis to the cases that you have clinical, mutation and expresison data. 

Action 3: Plot the number of non-synonymous mutations per case for your cohort. This should be in the form of a barplot (x-axis: patients, y-axis: number of non-synonymous mutations for the case)

Note, this is a group deliverable. Print your names and group numbers on top of the page. Similar to previous deliverables, we expect R Markdown knitted PDF.
